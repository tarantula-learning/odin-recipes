    <h1>Chunky Monkey Milkshake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am not a <em>huge</em> sweets fan, but I <b>love</b> this milkshake so much. I used to purchase it all the time 
    until I learned how simple it was to make at home. You do not need elaborate ingredients and you can substitute items as well; it is a 
pretty versatile recipe in my opinion.</p>
